**## **M365 Security**** 


MS Strategy


Effective defense dramatically increases the costs to the attacker


Assume identities are always under attack


Defense in depth is a must


Protect, detect and respond


Always assume you have been compromised


Attacker only needs to find one vulnerability


One advantage of the cloud is the shareds responsibility


Cloud also provides better threat detection


Large public cloud providers can invest billions


Increate Attackers Cost


Defend against cheapest attacks


Prossess a good detection ands response process to limit attackers lateral movement


Develop defense against potential and future attacks


O365 ATP provides an attack simulator


Using the secure score


Improvement actions


What is the Anti Malware Pipeline?


First mail is processed by techniques such as IP and sender reputation, combined with heuristics


Next it is scanned by multiple signature based anti virus scanners


EOP scans inviditual files


Heuristic clustering is used to identitfy suspicious mail


A sample from a cluster is sent to a hypervisor sandbox and the file is opened for further analysis


Signals are collected, the results are run through a machine learning (ML) method


IF M365 ATP is eanbled, ATP extens the protection


Zero Hour Auto Purge


Monitor updates to spam and malware signatures and can identify previously undetected malicious messages already in users inboxes


Unopened spam is moved to junk mail


Malware is stripped from mail regardless if it has been opened or not


Reverse is also true


Spoofing and Phishing Protection


EOP supports email authentication technique


Sender Policy Framwork (SPF)


Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)


Domain based Messaging and Reporting Compliance (DMARC)


Spoof intelligence can provide insight into senders who are spoofing your domain


E5 Plan needed or ATP license


Safe Attachments

Dynamic Delivery not supported for OnPremise Hybrid System. Replace will be used instead


Safe Links


Microsoft Defender for Identity


Monitor on premises domain controllers


Captures network traffic and Windows events directly from your domain controllers


Analyzes the data for attacks and threats


AATP Sensor needed


Application Guard


Using hardware isolation, it helps prevent old and newly emerging attacks to help keep employees productive


Define trusted web sites and everything not on your list is considered untrusted


User opens untrusted site through Edge, then Edge opens the site in an isolated Hyper V enabled container


Application Control


W10 Entterprise license needed


Applications are untrusted by default


Can block unsigned scripts and MSIs


Application control policies apply to the computer as a whole and affect all users


Applications control rules include


Attributes of the codesigning certificate


Attributes of the apps binaries such as filename, version or hash


The reputation determined by MS Intelligent Security Graph


The identity of the process that initiated the installation


The path from which the app or file is launched


The process that launched the app or binary


Defender Exploit Protection


On by default


Host intrusion prevention capabilities from Windows 10


Exploit protection


Attack surface reduction rule


Network protection


**## **Threat intelligence**** 


Azure Sentinel


Cloud native SIEM (Security information and event management) tool that is built on Azure


Using the cloud and artifical intelligence to help security operations teams identify and stop cyber attacks before they cause harm


Includes MS threat intelligence stream and external threat intelligence streams


Collect data cloud scale


Detect previously undetected threats


Investigae threats with artifical intelligence


Automate response to incidents


**## **Information Protection****


Classifying Data


Create or view a document with protection enabled you will have four data classification option


Automatic, Recommended, Reclassification, User set


When a user sets a manual label, then it wont be automatically replaed


Sensitivity Labels (Unified labeling)


Metadata written to documents


Stay in clear text so DLP can read them


Travel with document regardless of location


Creation within compliance center  &gt; information protection


Preview: Labels for Azure, including SQL columns, files Azure Blob Storage and more


Documents can be encrypted and expire


Assign permissions can be: users, group, all auth users, specific email addresses or domains


Content marking: watermark, add a header/footer


Protection setting for groups and sites: Privacy and external user access settings, external sharing and conditional access settubgs


Labels are distributed by label policies to users


Apply this label by default?


Justification needed to remove label?


Enforces user to set a label


Provide user with a link to help page


Auto labeling policy avilable


AIP Super User


Ensures authorized people and services can always read and inspect the data that Azure Rights Management protectsf for your organization


If not Enabled by default


Must use PowerShell to enable Super User and assign users or groups to it


Enable AadrmSuperUserFeature


Set AadrmSuperUserGroup


Once enabled and assigned, can use it to manage protected content via PowerShell


Protect RMSFile


Unrpotect RMSFile


Set AIPFIleLabel


To monitor activity of RMS Admins


Get AadrmAdminLog


Customer Lockbox (E5 / Security Addon)


If Customer Lockbox is activated, then the Support Engineer sends a request from their superior and the customer needs to approve the access


Protecting Data Access in Microsoft 365
